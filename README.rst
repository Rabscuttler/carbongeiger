Sandbag's Carbon Geiger Counter
----------------------------------------------------

What is it?
=========== 
Sandbag's Carbon Geiger Counter is to carbon dioxide emissions what the Geiger counter is to radioactivity. Move your phone around and a vibrating beep will point you in the direction of your nearest giant carbon polluter.

Why?
====
Climate change is not happening by accident - since the industrial revolution the fossil fuel emissions we have been spewing out that build up in the atmosphere have been the main cause of the problem. And they continue to spew forth at an alarming rate. The biggest sources are the power stations and factories dotted around our landscape. Since 2005 the EU commission in Brussels has applied legal caps on emissions for these largest sources of pollution.

Sandbag works to educate people about these caps, lobbying for them to be tightened. We have lots of data on them - exactly how much each factory and power station emits each year, who owns them, and how many pollution permits they have been given that allow them to carry on. We even know where they are buying any 'carbon offsets' from to meet their targets.

Carbon pollution isn't yet seen in the same light as radiation pollution but who knows one day it may be - and being able to track down who's responsible will be an important tool for civil society to demand action to stop this threat.


TODO
====
* LOTS! Carbon Geiger started as a pet project and could do with lots of work on refining the UI, adding features, etc..
